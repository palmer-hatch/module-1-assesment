// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/


// planning
// analysis of requirements
// design
// implementation
// testing & integration
// Maintain
/*


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the 
    values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
let analysisofrequirements = "Defining what the system is supposed to do. Establishing certain feature sets and how they would accomplish the goal. Also defining what kind of resources you will need to complete the project"
let design = "modeling the way the software will work, how users will interface with it, and defining which platforms and languages this program will run"
let implementation = "Actually writing and executing what you have planned out to create"
let testingandintegration = "testing to see if the software works before opening to the public. Running it through QA and beta testers and whatever other automated systems you have in place"
let Maintain = "Software is never complete, going back and fixing bugs and providing updates so the software can continually get better."
